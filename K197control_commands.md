# Gemini control protocol, commands 
Commands are sent from the IEEE488 to the K197

## Measurement Data Format

A command structure is represented as follows:

| Byte | Bit 7 | Bit 6 | Bit 5 | Bit 4 | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0 |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| B0   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B1   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B2   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B3   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B4   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |

- Each byte (B0 to B3) represents a part of the command data.
- Bit 7 is the Most Significant Bit (MSB), and Bit 0 is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).

## Encoding and Transmission

Commands are transmitted by the gemini framing protocol. The protocol encodes and transmits each byte of the measurement data in a series of sub-frames, with each sub-frame containing one byte of data.

For example, to transmit a command:

- Byte B0 is transmitted in a sub-frame with the start bit (1) and the 8 data bits representing B0.
- Byte B1 is transmitted in the next sub-frame, and so on.
- This continues until the complete frame with all 5 bytes are transmitted, each byte in its own sub-frame.

## Example

Here's an example of how a measurement result is encoded and transmitted within sub-frames:

| Sub-Frame | Start Bit (1) | Data (8 bits) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1         | 1             | B0            |
| 2         | 1             | B1            |
| 3         | 1             | B2            |
| 4         | 1             | B3            |
| 5         | 1             | B4            |

# Command Data - B0 Encoding

Description: This section explains how Byte B0 of the command strcuture is encoded. B0 controls dB mode, relative measurement and measurement range.

## Byte B0 Format

Byte B0 is structured as follows:

| Bit 7-6 (Db) | Bit 5-4 (Relative) | Bit 3-0 (Range) |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| dB mode      | Relative mode      | Range           | 

- Bits 7 and 6 (Unit) together control the dB mode:
  - 10: dB mode off
  - 11: dB mode on
  - 00: no change
  - 01: reserved (do not use)
 
- Bits 5 and 4 (Relative) together control the Relative mode:
  - 10: Relative mode off
  - 11: Relative mode on
  - 00: no change
  - 01: reserved (do not use)
 
### Measurement Range

Bits 3-0 (Range) specify the measurement range. 

Bit 3 is the "set range" flag:
  - 0: Do not change the range
  - 1: Set the range according to bits 2-0

Bit 2-0 specifies the range:
  - 0x0: Set range to Auto
  - 0x1: Set range to 200 mv (Volt mode) or 200 Ohm (Ohm mode)
  - 0x2: Set range to 2 V (Volt mode) or 2 KOhm (Ohm mode)
  - 0x3: Set range to 20 V (Volt mode) or 20 KOhm (Ohm mode)
  - 0x4: Set range to 200 V (Volt mode) or 200 KOhm (Ohm mode)
  - 0x5: Set range to 1 KV (Volt mode) or 2-200 MOhm (Ohm mode)
  - 0x6: Reserved
  - 0x7: Reserved

## Example

Here's an example of Byte B0 with various parameters set:

| Bit 7-6 (Db) | Bit 5-4 (Relative) | Bit 3-0 (Range) |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 00           | 10                 | 1000            | 

In this example:
- The dB mode is not changed.
- Measurement will be absolute (if Relative mode was set it is cleared).
- Set auto range.

## Notes

- Setting the range has an effect only in Volt and Ohm mode, where it will override the front panel switches
- If the range is subsequently changed with the front panel switches, it will override the value set via IEEE 488 interface (at least with firmware A01).
- In Ampere mode, setting the range via IEEE 488 interface has no effect

# Command Data - B1 Encoding

Description: This section explains how Byte B1 of the command strcuture is encoded. B1 is used for setting the trigger mode and remote/local indication


## Byte B1 Format

Byte B1 is structured as follows:

| Bit 7 (Control mode) | Bit 6 (Undefined) | Bit 5 (Control mode) | Bit 4 (Undefined) | Bit 3-0 (trigger mode) |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Set Control flag     | Reserved          | Remote Indication    | Reserved          | Trigger Mode           |

- Bit 7 is the Set Control flag:
  - 0: do not change the remote/local control indication
  - 1: Set the control indication according to the value of bit 5 (Control mode)

- Bit 6 (Reserved) is undefined and should be set to 1.

- Bit 5 (control Mode) controls the remote/local indication on the front panel:
- 0 : set local control mode (RMT indicator on the front panel is not shown)
- 1 : set remote control mode (RMT indicator on the front panel is shown)

- Bit 4 (Reserved) is undefined and should be set to 1.

### Trigger Mode
Bits 3-0 (Range) specify the trigger  mode. 

Bit 3 is the "set trigger mode" flag:
  - 0: Do not change the trigger mode
  - 1: Set the trigger mode according to bits 2-0

Bit 2-0 specifies the trigger mode:
  - 000: Reserved
  - 001: Reserved
  - 010: Continuos trigger on TALK/GET event (corresponds to mode T0 and T2 in the K197 IEEE 488 manual)
  - 011: One shot trigger on TALK/GET event (corresponds to mode T1 and T3 in the K197 IEEE 488 manual)
  - 100: TALK/GET event (used to trigger the voltmeter, corresponds to a TALK or GET event in the IEEE bus)
  - 101: Reserved
  - 110: Continuos trigger on Execute (corresponds to mode T4 in the K197 IEEE 488 manual)
  - 111: Continuos trigger on Execute (corresponds to mode T4 in the K197 IEEE 488 manual)

## Example

Here's an example of Byte B1 with various parameters set:

| Bit 7 (Control mode) | Bit 6 (Undefined) | Bit 5 (Control mode) | Bit 4 (Undefined) | Bit 3-0 (trigger mode) |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 0                    | 1                 | 0                    | 1                 | 1011                   |

In this example:
- The control mode is not changed.
- Trigger mode is set to "One shot trigger on TALK/GET event"

After this command is received, the Voltmeter will stop masuring. A single meaasurement will be triggered when a new command is received indicating a TALK/GET event (bits 3-0 in B1 set to 1100). 

# Command Data - B2 Encoding

Description: This section explains how Byte B2 of the command structure is encoded. B2 is used to control the source of the measurement (display or stored readings)

## Byte B2 format

| Bit 7 (Reading mode flag) | Bit 6 (Undefined) | Bit 5 (Reading mode) | Bit 4-0 (Undefined) |
|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Reading Mode flag         | Reserved          | Reading Source       | Reserved            |

- Bit 7 is the Reading Mode flag:
  - 0: Do not change the reading mode
  - 1: Set the reading mode according to bit 5
 
- Bit 6 (Reserved) is undefined and should be set to 0.

- Bit 5 (Reading Mode) controlled the source of the readings sent by the K197:
  - 0: The source is the measurement data displayed on the front panel 
  - 1: Set source is the storede data (K197 data logger function)

# Command Data - B3 Encoding

Byte B3 is reserved and should always be set to 0

# Command Data - B4 Encoding

Byte B4 is reserved and should always be set to 0
