# Gemini protocol Layer
Description: The framing layer divides the continuous bitstream into frames and sub-frames to facilitate data transmission. Frames may contain optional synchronization sequences to aid in frame detection.

## how the gemini protocol works
The gemini layer is responsible for exchanging bits between two peers. Normally one peer is configured to initiate the communication and is the one controlling when the communication starts and ends. 

When the initiator want to send a bit to the other side, it will set the outup pin high, then set it according to the bit value and wait for an acknowledgement ((up to a maximum time, then it will time-out)). When the other peer detects a positive edge, it will wait for a predetermined setup time, read the value of the input pin and acknowledge generating a positive edge on its own output pin. The acknowledgment is also used to send a bit in the opposite direction in the same way.

When sending a 0 bit, a short pulse is generated on the output pin. The duration of the pulse should be significantly shorter than the setup time, otherwise it could be misunderstood for a 1 level. However it should be long enough to be detected by the other peer (for the K197, it should be at least 1 microsecond long to be detected reliably).

The K197 is always the initiator.

# Gemini Frame Layer

Description: The framing layer divides the continuous bitstream into frames and sub-frames to facilitate data transmission. Frames may contain optional synchronization sequences to aid in frame detection.

## Frame Structure

A frame consists of the following components:

| Component                   | Description                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Synchronization Sequence    | Optional, composed of zero bits (0x00)              |
| Sub-Frames                  | Optional, contains data and start bit (described below)       |
| Synchronization Sequence    | Optional, composed of zero bits (0x00)              |

All components are optional, but obviously at least one component must be present for a frame to exist

Timeout (t_frame): if no data is sent within a t_frame time interval (frame timout), the next bit will be considered as the start of a new frame


## Sub-Frame Structure

A sub-frame contains the following components:

| Component            | Description                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Start Bit (1)        | Indicates the start of a sub-frame |
| Data (8 bits)        | Contains 8 bits of data            |

## Frame Synchronization

- The synchronization sequence (if used) consists of zero bits and is placed at the beginning of the frame.
- Its purpose is to aid in frame detection and synchronization. It is also used when the number of sub-frames in the two directions are different, due to the fact that the number of bits sent in each direction must be the same (for each bit sent in one direction there is a corrresponding bit sent in the opposite direction). 

The K197 add a synchronization sequence at the beginning of the communication, the IEEE488 card may add synchronization sequences at the end of the communication 

## Data Encoding in Sub-Frames

- Data bytes are encoded in sub-frames using MSB (Most Significant Bit) first and LSB (Least Significant Bit) last.

## Example Frame

Here's an example of a frame structure with a synchronization sequence:

| Component                   | Value (Hex) |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Synchronization Sequence    | 0x00 0x00   |
| Sub-Frame 1                | 0x81 [Data] |
| Sub-Frame 2                | 0x42 [Data] |
| ...                         | ...         |
| Sub-Frame N                | 0xF5 [Data] |

## Notes

- For generic use (anything other than contro0lling the K197 voltmeter), the use of synchronization sequences can vary depending on the application requirements.
- t_frame is a timeout value that determines when a new frame starts if no bits are sent within it.
- Make sure to adjust the frame and sub-frame structure according to the specific needs of your application.

# K197 control protocol layer - Sending Measurement Results

Description: This section outlines how measurement results are encoded by the K197 and transmitted to the IEEE card using the lower layer protocols. Each measurement consists of 4 bytes, where each byte contains data from bit7 (MSB) to bit0 (LSB).

## Measurement Data Format

A single measurement result is represented as follows:

| Byte | Bit 7 | Bit 6 | Bit 5 | Bit 4 | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0 |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| B0   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B1   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B2   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| B3   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |

- Each byte (B0 to B3) represents a part of the measurement data.
- Bit 7 is the Most Significant Bit (MSB), and Bit 0 is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).
- Measurements may consist of multiple 4-byte segments.

## Encoding and Transmission

Measurement results are transmitted within sub-frames as part of the data payload. The protocol encodes and transmits each byte of the measurement data in a series of sub-frames, with each sub-frame containing one byte of data.

For example, to transmit a measurement result:

- Byte B0 is transmitted in a sub-frame with the start bit (1) and the 8 data bits representing B0.
- Byte B1 is transmitted in the next sub-frame, and so on.
- This continues until all 4 bytes of the measurement are transmitted in separate sub-frames.

## Example

Here's an example of how a measurement result is encoded and transmitted within sub-frames:

| Sub-Frame | Start Bit (1) | Data (8 bits) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1         | 1             | B0            |
| 2         | 1             | B1            |
| 3         | 1             | B2            |
| 4         | 1             | B3            |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Measurement Result Data - B0 Encoding

Description: This section explains how Byte B0 of the measurement result is encoded. B0 contains various parameters, including the measurement unit, AC/DC, relative measurement, and measurement range.

## Byte B0 Format

Byte B0 is structured as follows:

| Bit 7-6 (Unit) | Bit 5 (AC/DC) | Bit 4 (Undefined) | Bit 3 (Relative) | Bit 2-0 (Range) |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Unit           | AC/DC         | Undefined         | Relative         | Range          |

- Bits 7 and 6 (Unit) together represent the measurement unit, as follows:
  - 00: Volt
  - 10: Ampere
  - 01: Ohm
  - 11: Decibel (dB)

- Bit 5 (AC/DC) represents the AC/DC nature of the measurement:
  - 0: DC (Direct Current)
  - 1: AC (Alternating Current)

- Bit 4 (Undefined) is undefined and reserved for future use.

- Bit 3 (Relative) indicates a relative measurement when set to 1.

- Bits 2-0 (Range) indicate the measurement range and can assume values from 1 to 6.

## Encoding of Measurement Unit

The measurement unit in Byte B0 is encoded using bits 7 and 6 (Unit), as described earlier.

## AC/DC Nature

Bit 5 (AC/DC) indicates whether the measurement is AC or DC. When it is set to 0, the measurement is DC; when set to 1, the measurement is AC.

## Relative Measurement

Bit 3 (Relative) indicates a relative measurement when set to 1.

## Measurement Range

Bits 2-0 (Range) specify the measurement range and can assume values from 1 to 6.

## Example

Here's an example of Byte B0 with various parameters set:

| Bit 7-6 (Unit) | Bit 5 (AC/DC) | Bit 4 (Undefined) | Bit 3 (Relative) | Bit 2-0 (Range) |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 0              | 1             | 0                 | 1                | 101            |

In this example:
- The measurement unit is Ampere (01).
- The measurement is AC (Alternating Current).
- Bit 4 is undefined.
- It is a relative measurement.
- The measurement range is 5.

## Notes

- Undefined bits should be ignored (seems to be always set to 1).

# Measurement Result Data - B1 Encoding

Description: This section explains how Byte B1 of the measurement result is encoded. B1 contains information about the sign of the measurement, an overrange flag, and the 5 most significant bits of the display count.

## Byte B1 Format

Byte B1 is structured as follows:

| Bit 7 (Sign) | Bit 6 (Undefined) | Bit 5 (Overrange) | Bit 4-0 (Display Count MSB) |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Sign         | Undefined         | Overrange         | Display Count MSB           |

- Bit 7 (Sign) represents the sign of the measurement:
  - 1: Negative
  - 0: Positive

- Bit 6 (Undefined) is undefined and should be set to 1.

- Bit 5 (Overrange) is the overrange flag, indicating an overrange condition when set to 1.

- Bits 4-0 (Display Count MSB) represent the 5 most significant bits of the display count.

## Sign of the Measurement

Bit 7 (Sign) indicates whether the measurement is positive or negative:
- 1: Negative
- 0: Positive

## Undefined Bit

Bit 6 (Undefined) is undefined and should be set to 1.

## Overrange Flag

Bit 5 (Overrange) serves as an overrange flag. It is set to 1 to indicate an overrange condition.

## Display Count MSB

Bits 4-0 (Display Count MSB) represent the 5 most significant bits of the display count.

## Example

Here's an example of Byte B1 with various parameters set:

| Bit 7 (Sign) | Bit 6 (Undefined) | Bit 5 (Overrange) | Bit 4-0 (Display Count MSB) |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1            | 1                 | 0                 | 11010                       |

In this example:
- The measurement is negative.
- Bit 6 is undefined and set to 1.
- There is no overrange condition (Bit 5 is 0).
- The 5 most significant bits of the display count are 11010.

# Measurement Result Data - B2 and B3 Encoding

Description: This section explains how Bytes B2 and B3 of the measurement result encode the least significant bits of the display count.

## Byte B2 and B3 Format

Bytes B2 and B3 are structured as follows:

### Byte B2:

| Bit 7-0 (Display count LSB) |
|-----------------------------|
| Display count bits 8-15     |

- Bits 7-0 (Display count LSB) represent bit 8-15 of the display count.

### Byte B3:

| Bit 7-0 (Display count LSB) |
|-----------------------------|
| Display count LSB           |

- Bits 7-0 (Display count LSB) represent the 8 least significant bits of the display count.

## Display count LSB

Bytes B2 and B3 together represent the 16 least significant bits of the display count. They contain the least significant bits of the display count value.

## Example

Here's an example of Bytes B2 and B3 with display count LSB values:

### Byte B2:

| Bit 7-0 (Display count LSB) |
|-----------------------------|
| 11011010                    |

### Byte B3:

| Bit 7-0 (Display count LSB) |
|-----------------------------|
| 00101101                    |

In this example, B2 and B3 together encode the 16 least significant bits of the display count.

# Measurement Result Data - B0 to B3 Encoding and Value Calculation

Description: This section explains how to obtain the measurement value from Bytes B0 to B3 of the measurement result.

## Byte B0 to B3 Format

Bytes B0 to B3 are structured as follows:

### Byte B0:

| Bit 7-6 (Unit) | Bit 5 (AC/DC) | Bit 4 (Undefined) | Bit 3 (Relative) | Bit 2-0 (Range) |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Unit           | AC/DC         | Undefined         | Relative         | Range          |

### Byte B1:

|-----------------------------|
| Display Count LSB           |

### Byte B3:

| Bit 7-0 (Display Count LSB) |
|-----------------------------|
| Display Count LSB (big endian)|

## Procedure to Obtain Measurement Value

To calculate the measurement value from Bytes B0 to B3, follow these steps:

1. Extract the measurement unit from Byte B0 using bits 7 and 6. The unit is determined as follows:
   - 00: Volt
   - 10: Ampere
   - 01: Ohm
   - 11: dB

2. Check Bit 5 of Byte B1 (Overrange flag). If it is set (1), an overrange condition is indicated.

3. Extract the sign of the measurement from Bit 7 of Byte B1. If it is set (1), the measurement is negative; otherwise, it is positive.

4. Combine the 16-bit Display Count value from Bytes B2 and B3. These bytes contain the least significant bits of the Display Count.

5. The Display Count represents a 21-bit binary number that encodes an unsigned long integer within the range 0 to 2,097,152 (corresponding to 0 to 400,000 in the voltmeter's display, ignoring sign and decimal point).

6. Apply the measurement unit to the Display Count value based on the unit extracted in step 1. This gives you the raw measurement value.

7. Depending on the range (Bit 2-0 in Byte B0), scale the raw measurement value by dividing or multiplying it by the appropriate power of 10. The exact scaling factor should be determined based on your protocol's specifications.

8. If the overrange flag is set (step 2), handle the overrange condition according to your protocol's specifications.

9. If the sign bit is set (step 3), negate the measurement value obtained in step 7 to account for the negative sign.

10. The result obtained in step 9 represents the final measurement value, scaled to the appropriate unit and range.

## Resolution Note

Please note that the Display Count provides slightly better resolution compared to what is displayed by the voltmeter. However, the extra resolution is not significant because it is smaller than the measurement error according to the voltmeter's specifications (more experimentation is needed to understand if there are special cases where the extra resolution could be significant).

## Example

Here's an example calculation using Bytes B0 to B3:

- Byte B0: 00000101 (Unit = Ohm)
- Byte B1: 01000000 (Positive, No Overrange)
- Byte B2: 11011010 (Display Count LSB)
- Byte B3: 00101101 (Display Count LSB)

Procedure:
- Unit: Ohm (from B0)
- Overrange: No (from B1)
- Sign: Positive (from B1)
- Display Count: 1101101000101101 (from B2 and B3)
- Scaling Factor: Determined by range and protocol specifications

Final Measurement Value: 87021 Ohms (Scaled and considering unit and sign)
