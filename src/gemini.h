      @brief gemini protocol lower layer handler

      @details define a class implementing the lower layer of the gemini protocol specification
      The lower layer is responsible for sending and receiving bits.

      After construction, begin() must be called before using any other function. Then update() must be called on a regular basis.
      
      When data is received, it is stored in an input buffer and hasData() will return true. Data can then be read with receive.

      For practical reasons, this class is also tasked to detect the frame end due to timout. however, the relevant members are protected,
      considering that the complete gemini frame specification should be implemented in a superclass.
